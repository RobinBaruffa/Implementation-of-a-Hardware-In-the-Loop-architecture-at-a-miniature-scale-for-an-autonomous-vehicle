# Implementation-of-a-Hardware-In-the-Loop-architecture-at-a-miniature-scale-for-an-autonomous-vehicle

This repository is dedicatd to a project realized in by Robin Baruffa and Jacques Pereira during the Spring semester of 2020 in partnership with the Université de Technologie de Belfort-Montbéliard (UTBM) and the CIAD Laboratory.
A 4 wheeled miniature car was built, based on a SunFounder kit, in order to experiment with the possibility of using a miniature robotic platform in order to prototype Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) architectures. This approach has numerous advantages, such as being able to benchmark various architectures and control algotithms prior to having access to real (and often expensive) hardware.

#  The academic paper

The project served as a basis for writing and publishing a paper in SIMUL 2020 : The Twelfth International Conference on Advances in System Simulation.
