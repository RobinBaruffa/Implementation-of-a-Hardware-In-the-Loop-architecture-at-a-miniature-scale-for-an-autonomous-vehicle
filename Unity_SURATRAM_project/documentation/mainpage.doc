/// ## Modify the path following parameters
///
/// Go in the GameObject>SplineWalker and interactively sets the new behaviour you want.
///
/// ## Call every frame of static objects
///
/// Static objects that have an *Update* or *FixedUpdate* simply have its function called by the script *informations.cs* instanciated on Canvas->Text.
///
/// ## Add a new type of sensor
///
/// Create the sensor and add an event (usually called "OnScanned"), which sends data when the scan occurs.
///
/// Create a class that inherits "SensorExport". This class will listen to the event and add it to the data to send. We can vaguely consider it as a data-buffering between each data sendings.
///
/// You then have to add it to the JSONCreator constructor (careful, match the right id !). JSONConstructor manage the JSONCreation, the data sending and the "SensorExport" class (each time the data is send, the buffers are cleared.).
